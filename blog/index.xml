      <description>I have reviewed and tried a lot of different ways to create a personal Blog so that I can share Code, Knowledge, Pictures and do Reviews. After spending some time with Hugo it has become the framework that I have liked the most. The Theme &amp;ldquo;Hugo Future Imperfect&amp;rdquo; is also the Hugo Theme that I have liked the most.

Some of the ways I have reviewed creating a Blog require a monthly fee to host the web site for you.</description>
